Launching 
	roslaunch sim_envs kitchen.launch
starts up the gazebo kitchen environment, loads the robot in the environment,
starts up the controllers for the wheel velocities, starts up the publishing
of laser scan messages from the rplidar and starts up the publishing of 
pointcloud messages from the kinect.


Launching 
	roslaunch rosbot_navigation rosbot_teleop.launch 
starts up the keyboard teleoperation. It doesn't publish 0 when key is released so
you'd have to watch out for that.


Launching 
	roslaunch sim_envs keyboard_teleop.launch
starts up the keyboard teleoperation. It publishes 0 when 
you take your hands off the keyboard keys. It also performs
some form of PID control.
